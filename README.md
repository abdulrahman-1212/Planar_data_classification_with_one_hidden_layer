# Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer
This is an implementation of one-hidden-layer neural network. It is Assignment 3 in deep learning specialzation course 1.

<h3>The problem<h3>:
  <ul>
    <li>Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer</li>
    <li>Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh</li>
    <li>Compute the cross entropy loss</li>
    <li>Implement forward and backward propagation</li>
  <ul>
